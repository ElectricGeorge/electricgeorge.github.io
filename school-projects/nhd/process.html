				<h2>Project Info</h2>
				<h3>Process</h3>
				<p>I chose this topic because my first topic, the FCC Freeze, didn't provide many sources. We were already discussing the Cold War in class, so the Truman Doctrine really fit. It also seemed like a topic in my interest. <br>I started my reaserch by looking up the Truman Doctrine. I found a few sources that gave me a good explanation of what it was and why it was made. I then branched off into Greece and Turkey. I looked into their conflicts and the state of their governments. I cited the sources with annotations and put all neccesary information on notecards. <br>I chose to do a website because I like to code things and HTML is a nice thing to learn. I had to learn HTML and CSS along side my topic. My notecard information was categorized and copied into my HTML framework. Each page is a category. I took the copied information and changed the structure to make everything flow. Lastly, I put together pictures that relate to each category and placed them on each page. The site is hosted on GitHub, a free code sharing site. I used my domain I already owned. <br>This project relates to Conflict &amp; Compromise because the Truman Doctrine was the compromse to resolve Cold War conflicts. Conflicts in Greece and Turkey with Communism and the Soviet Union caused the US to step in and create a comprmise for the foreign policy.</p>
