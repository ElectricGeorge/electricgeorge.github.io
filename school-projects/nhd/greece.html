				<h2>Greece</h2>
				<h4>Terrorist Occurances</h4>
				<p>In Greece, Terrorists decided to burn down homes of people who were anti-monarchists. A directive was written to do this and murder people. 43 people were murdered in Athens after a 7 month period. In that same period, there were 81 thousand arrests. Multiple terror attacks occurred around 1946. The press was often the the biggest target for going against the communists. 477 newspaper offices were destroyed. 15 stopped publication because of this. Editors were arrested, exiled or even murdered.<br>Even thogh Greece was a monarchy, Britain had some of the responsibility of the Greek government. The Greek premier was selected by the British. Greece was actually The Kingdom of Greece. The communist government called themselves the Provisional Democratic Government, which was hardly democratic.</p>
				<h4>The Greek Civil War</h4>
				<p>The Greek Civil War was a war in 1946. It was a conflict between the Greek government army (Hellenic Army)(sided with the US and UK) and the Democratic Army of Greece (DSE)(Communist Party; KKE). The Truman doctrine was announced in the middle of the was and helped Greece defeat the Communists. Greece also received aid from the Marshall Plan and joined NATO.<br>The war started due to a riot in Athens. Greek government gendarmes opened fire on a pro-EAM rally. 28 were killed.</p>
				<h4>US Aid</h4>
				<p> The economic difficulties after WWII was a root cause of these communist treats. The more a country's economy suffers, the more likely they could lose their democracy. This ultimately caused a civil war. Greece benefitted from the Truman Doctrine. The Communist Party might not have been defeated if it wasn't for the Doctrine. The war ended thanks to British and American Aid.</p>
