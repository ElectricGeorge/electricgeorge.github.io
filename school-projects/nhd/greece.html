				<h2>Greece</h2>
				<h4>At the Time</h4>
				<p>In Greece, Terrorists decided to burn down homes of people who were anti-monarchs. A directive was written to do this and murder people. Multiple terror attacks occurred around 1946.<br>The press was often persecuted for going against the communists. 477 newspaper offices were destroyed. 15 stopped publication because of this. Editors were even murdered.<br>Britain had some of the responsibility of the Greek government. The Greek premier was selected by the British.</p>
				<h4>The Greek Civil War</h4>
				<p>The Greek Civil War was a war in 1946. It was a conflict between the Greek government army (sided with the US and UK) and the Democratic Army of Greece (Communist Party; KKE). The Truman doctrine was announced in the middle of the was and helped Greece defeat the Communists. Greece also received aid from the Marshall Plan and joined NATO.<br>The war started due to a riot in Athens. Greek government gendarmes opened fire on a pro-EAM rally. 28 were killed.</p>
				<h4>US Aid</h4>
				<p>Greece benefitted from the Truman Doctrine. The Doctrine was made in the middle of the Greek Civil War. The Communist Party possibly could not have been defeated if it wasn't for the Doctrine.<br>The economic difficulties after WWII brought threats to democracy. The more a country's economy suffers, the more likely they could lose their democracy.<br>The war ended thanks to British and American Aid.</p>
