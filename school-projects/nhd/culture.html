				<h4>See Magazine</h4>			<p>The Truman Doctrine was a new way to lasting peace. For too long, the US was minding it's own business and was dragged into war. The new foreign policy would help countries under threat of communism being pushed by the Soviet Union.<br>The magazine argues that the doctrine would help prevent the loss of lives. It brings up the 300,000 Americans who died in WWII.</p>

				<h4>The New York Times</h4>
				<p>The Truman Doctrine was regarded as a vital, non-partisan foreign policy. The president emphasizes that it is a step towards peace. It was given a lot of support by the press and all of congress.</p>
				<h3>US Intervention</h3>
				<p>The KKE (Greek Communists) published a formal response to America's aid. They claimed they don't need assistance but monetary assistance was welcome. The democratic influence was not welcome.<br>The Truman Doctrine allowed the US to intervene in European affairs. It also made a statement that communism could not win in war.</p>
