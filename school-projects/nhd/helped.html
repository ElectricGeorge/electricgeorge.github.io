				<h2>How It Helped</h2>
				<h4>A Summary From history.state.gov</h4>
				<p>Pres. Truman said he would provide assistance to all democratic countries in danger of a communist conversion. He changed our foreign policy to become more involved with conflicts that don't affect the US. After Britan Withdrew its assistance to these countries, the new foreign policy was put into effect. It gave $400 million plus military assistance to Greece and Turkey. This played a big part in keeping the middle east stable. The outcomes of the Greek Civil War could have been drastically different if it weren't for this policy. </p>
				<h4>The Marshall Plan</h4>
				<p>The Truman Doctrine didn't only provide help to Greece and Turkey. The Marshall Plan or European Recovery Program expanded the Doctrine to aid Europe as well as the middle east. The Aftermath of WWII caused much of Europe to be in ruin. The US thought that the state Europe was in could leave it vulnerable to the influence of the Soviet Union and the countries' own communist parties. Europe was hungry, devastated and in need of assistance. This assistance could not come from communist propaganda. America needed to jump in right away. The Marshall Plan was another program that provided countries with aid. $13 billion was given to Europe to reconstruct the economy and infrastructure. It was very successful in helping Europe. It boosted the American economy as well.</p>
				<h4>Problems in Greece and Turkey</h4>

				<p>Turkey:</p>
				<li>Turkish Straits (image at right) - Soviets pressured Turkey to allow free shipping through the Black Sea Straits. These straits were important for providing a trade route to the rest of the world.</li>
				<li>British Aid End - British assistance to Turkey ended in 1947. Turkey needed support to keep integrity in their government.</li>
				<p>Greece:</p>
				<li>EAM rally - National Liberation Front of the Greek Communists (KKE). A shooting at an EAM rally by the British in Athens resulted in civil war. The civil war was the ultimate decision between Communism and Democracy.</li>
				<li>Josip Tito was directly funding the KKE. The USSR, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania backed this side.</li>
