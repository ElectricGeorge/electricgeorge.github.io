				<h2>How It Helped</h2>
				<h4>A Summary From history.state.gov</h4>
				<p>Pres. Truman said he would provide assistance to all democratic countries in danger of communism.<br>It changed our foreign policy to become more involved with conflicts that don't affect the US.<br>The cause for the speech was an announcement from the British Government that said they would no longer assist Greece or Turkey.<br>Truman addressed Greece and Turkey. He asked congress for $400 million, military personnel, and equipment. Truman argued that a Communist victory would make the Middle East politically unstable. It could also threaten US national security.</p>
				<h4>The Marshall Plan</h4>
				<p>The Aftermath of WWII caused much of Europe to be in ruin. The US thought that the state Europe was in could cause a change to communism. Europe was hungry and devastated and needed assistance.<br>The Marshall Plan, much like the Truman Doctrine, was another program to provide countries with aid. $13 billion was given to Europe to reconstruct the economy and infrastructure.<br>It was very successful in helping Europe and boosted the American economy as well.</p>
				<h4>Problems in Greece and Turkey</h4>

				<p>Turkey--</p>
				<li>Turkish Straits (image at right) - Soviets pressured Turkey to allow free shipping through the Black Sea Straits. Tensions arose when the Turkish government denied them passage.</li>
				<li>British Aid End - British assistance to Turkey ended in 1947. Turkey needed support to keep control of the Straits.</li>
				<p>Greece--</p>
				<li>EAM rally - National Liberation Front of the Greek Communists (KKE). A shooting at an EAM rally by the British in Athens resulted in civil war.</li>
				<li>Josip Tito was directly funding the KKE. No help was given by the Soviets.</li>
