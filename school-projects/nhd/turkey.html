				<h4>Turkish Straits Crisis</h4>
				<p>The crisis was a conflict between the Soviet Union and Turkey. Turkey was neutral through WWII, but was pressured to allow Soviets to ship items freely through the Turkish Straits.<br>Tensions increased which eventually led Turkey to receive help from NATO and the US. This was a deciding factor in the Truman Doctrine.</p>
				<h4>Turkey &amp; NATO</h4>
				<p>The preface argues that the Soviet Union had little influence on the Middle East after the formation of the Truman Doctrine. When Turkey joined NATO, the Soviets knew Turkey was no longer neutral. Any threat that came to Turkey was now a US problem too. This eliminated most of the Soviet problems in the Middle East while the Turkish relationship with the US grew.</p>
