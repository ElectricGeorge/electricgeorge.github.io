				<h4>Turkish Straits Crisis</h4>
				<p>The crisis was a conflict between the Soviet Union and Turkey. Turkey was neutral through WWII, but was pressured to allow Soviets to ship items freely through the Turkish Straits. Turkey had warm relations in the past with Russia and allowed shipments through. Tensions arose when the Turkish government allowed a US naval vessel through. This was dismissed later as coincidental because it was delivering an urn of a late Turkish ambassador. The USSR still did not like the way Turkey was handling the straits.<br>As tensions increased, Turkey received help from NATO and the US. </p>
				<h4>Turkey &amp; NATO</h4>
				<p>The preface from the book, The US-Turkish-NATO Middle East Connection by Geoge McGhee, argues that the Soviet Union had little influence on the Middle East after the formation of the Truman Doctrine. When Turkey joined NATO, the Soviets knew Turkey was no longer a neutral party. Any threat that came to Turkey was now a US problem too. This eliminated most of the Soviet conflicts in the Middle East while the Turkish relationship with the US grew.</p>
