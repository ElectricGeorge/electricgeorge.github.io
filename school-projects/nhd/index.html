				<h3>The Truman Doctrine</h3>
				<p>During the Cold War, the Soviet Union influenced the growth of many countries. Greece and Turkey in particular were having issues with rebellions against their democratic governments. The Soviet Union was partially if not fully responsible for supporting these conflicts. <br>America at the time had a very strict foreign policy on aiding other countries with their struggles. President Harry S. Truman believed that there was a high risk of many countries converting to communism. He needed to amend the foreign policy so the US could assist countries under this threat. President Truman presented the Truman Doctrine to congress, a compromise that would allow the US to help other countries.</p>
				<h3>Thesis</h3>
				<p>The Truman Doctrine, with the goal of preventing the domino theory from becoming a reality, affected the Cold Warâ€™s influence on democratic nations. Greece and Turkey, who were threatened with communism were assisted by this change to the US foreign policy.  With this change, the US would be able to help any country under risk of losing their democracy. Today, many of those countries governments are free of communism.</p>
