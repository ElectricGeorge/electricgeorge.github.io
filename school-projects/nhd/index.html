			<h2>What is it?</h2>
			<h4>The Truman Doctrine's Purpose</h4>
			<p>The purpose of the Truman Doctrine was to stop the soviet union from expanding. Greece and Turkey were threatened with communism and Truman pledged to stop it by aiding them.</p>
			<h4>Why it Was Written</h4>
			<p>The speech in which the doctrine was derived from was created because the British government stopped providing assistance to Greece against the Greek Communist Party.</p>
			<h4>The Announcement</h4>
			<p>On March 12, 1947, Pres. Truman explained to Congress that the world's governments might possibly follow in the soviet's footsteps and become communist. Greece and Turkey were threatened by communist terrorists. The US should support Greece so it could become a democracy. Turkey also needs aid because its government needs integrity. Truman requested $400 million two help the countries. It was approved 2 months later.</p>
			<h3>What it Did</h3>
			<h4>The Act</h4>
			<p>The president may decide to provide assistance to Greece and Turkey by:</p>
			<li>Giving financial aid</li>
			<li>Assigning military personnel</li>
			<li>Providing information or training</li>
			<p>The president must withdraw if:</p>
			<li>Government of countries request it</li>
			<li>The UN finds it unnecessary</li>
			<li>If the purposes of the act are already addressed</li>
			<h4>The Address</h4>
			<p>The Greek Government is asking for assistance from us. It is imperative that we provide assistance. Without it Greek may not be able to survive as a free nation.<br>
			Greece is poor; It lacks natural resources. Greece has suffered four years of enemy invasion. Much of the infrastructure was destroyed. The country's conditions are terrible. Greece does not have the funds to continue reconstruction and recovery. They ask us for our help and need it.<br>
			Greece is threatened by terrorism by the communists. Without support, it cannot become a democracy.<br>
			Turkey also needs support. Britain ended their economic support, so we need to step in. Financial aid will help keep national integrity.<br>
			We must provide Greece and Turkey with $400 million.  We also need to supply them with our military personnel. This is an investment which is a better alternative to the potential future.</p>
			<h4>Additional Info</h4>
			<p>The book says the Truman Doctrine was the result of Greece losing British economic support and the Soviet pressure on Turkey to allow shipments through the Sea Straights.<br>
			The Doctrine said that the US, as a free nation, had the obligation to support other free nations. We should provide assistance to nations under threat of losing their freedom.</p>
