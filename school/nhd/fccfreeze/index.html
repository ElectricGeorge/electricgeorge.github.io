  <h1>George's NHD Project</h1>
  <p>Television's Popularity was growing so fast that the FCC could not keep up. They were having organizational issues with frequency allocations. They needed to figure these out so the "TV band" had enough room and didn't start interfering with other bands. The FCC's best option for compromise was to freeze the issuing of new broadcast licenses which brought a new conflict between the government and broadcasting companies. The FCC began the suspension in 1948. There weren't many TV stations in the US so it was very rare to have a TV station in your area for the 4 years in which the freeze lasted. Many stations were on a waiting list, ready to start broadcasting.</p>
